This is a clarification of the parameters args[] provided for the Main.java


      the encryption process should be tested first.
      Because the decryption will decrypt the content of the file created after the encyprtion.
      Otherwise "file not found" exception will be thrown



"e" or "d" : arg[0] : encryption or decryption of the plaintext
"ecb" or "cbc" : args[1] : the mode of the process
"path\\KeyFile" : args[2] : the path of the text file of the key
"path\\InputFile" : args[3] : the path of the text file of the the input (plaintext)
"path\\plaintext.enc" : args[4] : the path of the encrypted plaintext
"path\\plaintext.enc.dec" : args[5] : the path of the decrypted cipher text. This file contents is the same of the input file.
"path\\plaintext.enc.debugging" : args[6] : the path of the step by step debugging of the encryption process.
"path\\plaintext.enc.dec.debugging" : args[7] : the path of the step by step debugging of the decryption process.
